# Disease Outbreak Prediction Using AI and ML

## Overview
This project predicts disease outbreaks, particularly focusing on predicting the spread and intensity of COVID-19 in different regions. The model is built using AI and ML to analyze historical data and predict future outbreaks. The project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, with no-code tools for rapid prototyping and building the model.

## Features
- **AI & ML-based Predictions**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of disease outbreaks.
- **COVID-19 Focus**: The primary dataset used is focused on COVID-19 cases, but the model can be extended to predict other diseases.
- **Real-time Reporting**: Tracks and predicts the spread and intensity of the outbreak in various regions.
- **No-Code Tools**: The project utilizes no-code tools (such as Bolt) to streamline the development process and allow for quick prototyping without writing extensive code.
- **Frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the prediction model.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building the user interface.
- **AI & ML**: Machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **No-Code Tools**: Used for building certain aspects of the application without writing code (e.g., Bolt).
- **Flask**: A lightweight framework for deploying the web application and running the prediction model.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for data exploration and experimentation.
